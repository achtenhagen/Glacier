<!--

The main uses for a global page are:

To hold the logic for handling Safari toolbar items.
To hold the logic for handling extension menus and contextual menu items.
To hold the logic for handling settings changes.
To hold large blocks of logic or data used by extension bars.
To hold large blocks of logic or data used by injected scripts.
You can also use the global page to hold logic or data used by a popover, but if the popover is specified in Extension Builder, the popover file loads only once,
just like the global page file, so there is no gain in efficiency.
If you have multiple popovers that use the same data or logic, however, it makes sense to have one copy in the global page, instead of a copy in each popover.
